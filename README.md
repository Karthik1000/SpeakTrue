Natural Language Processing Project

Here I have attached my presentation and term paper for this project. You can see those.

How to run this project ?
1. Before running this you have to download and copy the json file for translation.(I have removed json file for security purposes)
2. If anyone want how to get that json file then you refer this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YapTts_An9A&ab_channel=JieJenn
3. After that you can run the django project 
4. python manage.py runserver
